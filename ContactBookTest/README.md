# ContactBookTest
Simple C# skill test. Contact book with JSON as DB

Build a simple console app that will demonstrate the use of abstraction (Interface), Language Integrated Query (LINQ) and other basic C# building blocks.

I have built a skeleton to ease your understanding of what i expect. Clone from here https://github.com/PrinceTegaton/ContactBookTest

Problem
I have a simple contact book app that will allow
1. Create a new contact
2. Preview all contacts
3. Delete contact

Datastore is JSON. Use a simple file named ContactDB.json as the database. All CRUD operations are to be done via LINQ on the deserialized dataset list then serialized and saved to/from the JSON file/database.

Make use of interface for the business logic implementation.

Keep it simple and clean.. The contact info model should contain
1. ID (auto)
2. Name
3. Phone number
4. Email address

Delete operation should be 'hard delete'.

Time is 3hr max.
Push your solution to github and share repo when done.
